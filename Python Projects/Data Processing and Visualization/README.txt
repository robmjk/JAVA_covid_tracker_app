Data Processing and Visualization Project:

Overview:
Welcome to the Data Processing and Visualization Project! This project focuses on processing data from CSV files related to species taxonomy, suburbs, and councils. The provided Python code performs various tasks such as reading data, counting occurrences of different categories, and generating visualizations.

Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to streamline the analysis of data concerning species taxonomy, suburbs, and councils. By automating data processing tasks, we aim to facilitate insights into species distribution patterns, administrative divisions, and related trends. The code provided offers a foundation for efficient data management and visualization.

Project Components:
The project consists of the following components:

species_taxon.csv: A CSV file containing species data and their corresponding taxonomy.
suburb_council-v2.csv: A CSV file containing suburb and council data.
main.py: The main Python script responsible for data processing and visualization.

Usage:
Ensure that the CSV files (species_taxon.csv and suburb_council-v2.csv) are placed in the same directory as main.py.
Run the script by executing: python main.py
The script will process the data, count occurrences of categories, and generate pie charts for visualization.
